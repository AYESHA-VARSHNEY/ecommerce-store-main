# E-Commerce Store

Fully responsive fictitious ecommerce website for a dummy company -online store.co .  

Fully functional frontend, partially integrate with a backend at some point to make it an actual working site , where people can place fake orders. 
This website is my undergraduate project. I do not own any of the pictures used. These pictures were obtained from Google etc. . 

An eCommerce online store is like a virtual marketplace where you can buy things on the internet. It's a website where you can browse through products, choose what you want to buy, and then make a purchase online. Just like shopping in a physical store, but all online!
The online store.co website is designed to provide a user-friendly e-commerce platform that allows users to simply explore, purchase, and discover a wide range of products. The website's goal is to speed up the online shopping experience by enabling a smooth transition from product discovery to secure purchases, all while catering to customers' diverse needs and tastes.
